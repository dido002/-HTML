   <h1>Acedamic Level</h1>
   <main>
      <p>The journey I had so far very long. So far, I complete multiple schoolwork and still on the way with two programs as the same time. I complete high school 2005/6, started bachelor of Sciences and graduated 2008, then worked for two years and joint Wageningen University of the Netherlands for Master of Science 2010 â€“ 2013. Currently I am going Saint Louis College of Pharmacy for PharmD program and Launchcode LC101. 
         I hope that I will complete both program with the short period. I join LC101 because I have a dream to learn computer language.
